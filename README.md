### Cognitive Contour Detection of Sparse-Structured Objects in the Alpha-Shape Scale Space

This paper proposes a novel scale-space method for detecting cognitive contours of sparse-structured objects. Additionally, a benchmark image dataset of sparse-structured objects is constructed in this paper, which is publicly available for evaluating cognitive contour detection performance. Here are the code and the dataset for this paper.
